# Payment-Gateway-Integration

This website is created as a part of Internship at "The Sparks Foundation"

----The task was to create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated----
 
◇ The website has a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where the user can enter the amount and can also select payment type.

◇ Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount and basic information entered by the user during payment. 

◇ Razorpay is used as a payment gateway.
